                    <h3>About MeðŸ˜š</h3>
                    <p>I am Edina Kwamboka and am passionate in Technology,
                            am just a girl chasing her dreams and having an amazing adventure 
                          and I believe that you don't need a degree to work in Technology field
                         all you need is gumption and focus. It's OK not to know something as long
                          as you show that you're intelligent enough to learn it. </p>

                    <h3>How I spend my Time</h3>
                    <p>So on weekdays I attend classes as scheduled. In the evening I spend time with my best friend reading
                        and also browsing. On weekends, those are days for general cleaning and having fun. Sundays 
                          I go to church and at night prepare myself for classes on the next day. </p>

                    <p>These are days when I feel lke things are not working 
                        and am not in a good mood and I prefer to stay alone and sleep or write down what 
                        I feel so that I can change my mood.ðŸ˜‚It's funny,,but that works for me.
